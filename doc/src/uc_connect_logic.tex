\subsection{\tsl{How to :} Plug your own logic and semantic to \flatac ?}
The architecture of \flatac was made to be as generic as possible. One of our goals was that, whatever the complexity of your \tsl{\gls{ls}}, plugging it into \flatac has to be easy and efficient.

\newpar To comply with these aims, we designed a fairly simple architecture :\\
%\image{img/FrontEnd}{1}

\begin{center}\input{img/FrontEnd.tex}\end{center}

The \tsl{front-end} acts as an interface between the \gls{eCFG} algorithms and data structures, this way, even if the methods of the \tsl{front-end} are constrained, you can choose the way to implement your own \tsl{\gls{ls}}.
