Hi, 

 I have noted something which is a cause of concern when  it
comes to analyze some loops using CIL --The version provided by
the Frama-c distribution. I think it might be due to 


When I do analyze a statement which kind is If(exp,block,block,_), everything 
seems fine. I can analyze the expression exp, interpret it into
some boolean expression that is peculiar to our tool, and then 
I can analyze both blocks as well, and I get some analysis which is coherent
with the input code. The first block corresponding to the set of 
statements that should be executed when the test returns true, the second one 
corresponding to the case when the test return false.


However, when I have a loop --eg while( condition), or for(i=0;condition(i),i++),
then something pretty strange happen :


Even if I do traverse some If(exp,block,block,_) statement, as expected, 
then I get an empty block for the first block condition, even if 
in my source code there is some instruction to execute within the loop.
However, when I pick the successors from the statement list 
 -- In Cil_types.stmt, the field succs, typed as stmt list,
 my analysis performs well, at least on some small examples.


Is that normal, that under certain circumstances, I don't get a stmtkind
description that matches to the control flow graph description ? 

If you think this is not normal, I can send you some instances of code that
show the difference. However, if you think this behavior is normal, can you, please, just tell me a word about it, and perhaps add a short explanation in a 
footnote of the future realease API.


I am using the Nitrogen 20111001 realease.

Best regards and thanks in advance,
 Florent.
