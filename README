****** Content of the folder and summary of FLATAC purpose *********

The following folder contains the source files and building scripts
used to compile the front-end of the flatac tool chain.
This front-end is a FRAMA-C plugin, which aims at extracting 
a model of C programs, based on nunerical transitions systems
which control states are labelled using Simple Separation Logic
formulae.  Those models are latter anaysez by the FLATA tool,  
which checks whether there exists some executions
of the NTS that leads to a states that abstracts some program
states whose memory is corrupted ( Segmentation fault, alignement
error, etc ...)

Prior trying to compile this module, make sure you did compile
FRAMAC version Nitrogen or latter, and that you have in hands the
name of the source path of the current installed version of FRAMA-C.
 
To use the flatac toolchain, you must get the FLATA tool, available
here, with a fully and comprehensive installation procedure :
