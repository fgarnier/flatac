****** Content of the folder and summary of FLATAC purpose *********

The following folder contains the source files and building scripts
used to compile the front-end of the flatac tool chain.
This front-end is a FRAMA-C plugin, which aims at extracting 
a model of C programs, based on nunerical transitions systems
which control states are labelled using Simple Separation Logic
formulae.  Those models are latter anaysez by the FLATA tool,  
which checks whether there exists some executions
of the NTS that leads to a states that abstracts some program
states whose memory is corrupted ( Segmentation fault, alignement
error, etc ...)

This tool has been written and is build using the version
3.12 of the Ocaml compiler.
Prior trying to build this module, make sure you did compile
FRAMAC version Nitrogen or latter, and that you have in hands the
name of the source path of the current installed version of FRAMA-C.

To use the flatac toolchain, you must get the FLATA tool, available
here, with a fully and comprehensive installation procedure :

	      ********* Building OCaml Nts Lib *****
 You now need to install the OCaml Nts Library. To do so, get
 the current version of the Ocaml-nts lib from its public git 
 repository :

 $ git clone https://github.com/fgarnier/Ocaml-nts.git
 $ make nts_lib
 


               ********* Building FLATAC **********

To build Flatac plugin for frama-c, follow the step as described bellow

1) run ./configure FRAMAC_NITROGEN_SOURCE_PATH (e.g. ./configure ~/FRAMAC )
2) run make 
3) run make install

	     
 	       ********** Setting the toolchain scripts ******

1) Go inside the bin_script/ subdirectory, and tune the environment
   variable name in both the flatac and flata script, so that it fits 
   your own configuration. 

2) Add the the bin_scipt/ directory to your PATH global shell variable.
