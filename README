This is the source files for flata-c pluging. It aims to proves
that assert conditions, expressed using arithmetic constrainst are
always satified. The plugin computes a counter example trace if an
assert condition is not satisfied.

I) Requirements :

 Flata and ANTLR must belong to your classpath

II)  To generate the html API, you need to make sure that
your ocaml libs are indeed in the path /usr/lib/ocaml. If
they are not installed in this path then set the variable
LIB_OCAML_PATH with the proper path.
